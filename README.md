What the PPT Covers

Introduction to Arduino

Arduino is a programmable electronic circuit board used for electronics projects and robotics.

The microcontroller is the brain of Arduino that executes programmed instructions.

Key Features of Arduino

14 Digital Pins → Used for input/output (like LEDs, sensors).

Analog Pins → Used for reading continuous signals (like temperature or light sensors).

Voltage & Current Source → Supplies power to components.

Important Parts of the Arduino Board

Main Chip (Microcontroller) → Executes programs and controls components.

USB Interface → For programming and power supply.

Digital Pin Headers → Connect digital devices like LEDs, buttons, sensors.

Analog Pin Headers → Connect analog sensors.

Power Header → Provides power to Arduino and components.

DC Power Jack → Connect external power (battery, adapter).

USB Jack → Also for power and programming.

Reset Button → Restarts the running program.

LED Basics

LED has Anode (+) and Cathode (–).

Current flows only in one direction → if connected backwards, it won’t light and may get damaged.

Resistors

Passive electronic components.

They oppose current flow (measured in ohms).

Functions: control current, divide voltage, and protect components.
